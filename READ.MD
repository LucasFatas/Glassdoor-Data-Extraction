To run code, use terminal to input a command which will look like:

python main.py {link to first review page of company} {name of csv file you want data save on to} {number of pages (each page is 10 reviews)}

An example of that would be:

python main.py https://www.glassdoor.sg/Reviews/Bharti-Airtel-Reviews-E38320.htm bharti_airtel.csv 100

if number of pages is left blank, code will set limit to 100
