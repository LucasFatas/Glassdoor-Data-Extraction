The management listen to employees and compensation is quite good and competitive. Also you get a 13th month salary and revenue share if you have a good rating in the financial year. My advise is to be the best version of you and strive for excellence in everything you do and ensure your manager recognizes your good work.,"Your managers feedback on your performance highly determines how far you can go in the organization. If for any reason your manager doesn't like you, expect you would not get a good rating and you would be out the door in no time. Also expect you would always be overworked and stressed considering you would be assigned task and responsibility of 3 personnel. If you are a high performer who can work long hours, you have nothing to worry about here."

If you have a Godfather sitting here, you will be among highest paid employees in the Industry.  2. Market Leader in India.  3. A beautiful Head Office with all facilities","1. No growth, if there is no godfather in the company.  2. Other Telecom Employers do not give you interview call as it has no poaching agreement with all major telecom companies (operators and vendors).  3. Entire Company runs on Excel sheet, with no process or procedure of doing things and has no clue what is happening. Processes made are meant to be broken by senior management and are painfully justified to Auditors by Junior Management.  4. Growth path is only for Employees with Godfathers, General Quota employee suffers.  5. Even a B.A Pass promoted to a senior level in the Technical department and an Engineer gets downgraded.  6. From Executive to a Vice President, everyone does the same thing.  7. A complete Lalaji's shop culture with no professionalism.  8. Appraisal mechanism/portal is fake, employee with no godfather is rated least or even thrown out.HR Department is dummy.  9. Young Campus recruitees have a good growth path with Assistant Manager to Senior Manager in just 3 years, other employees (General Quota) are made to limp around for 4-5 years for one promotion.  10. Internal Politics is very high, a new comer will be made to struggle, hell of a lot while others with Godfather will enjoy the party.  11. Good sincere employees were either made to resign or simply thrown out of Airtel.  12. No clear focus, future or vision of doing things, everything is done in chaotic way.  13. Senior management here is highly paid (Crores Club), are actually a bunch of fools that got promoted while the company was growing. They treat themselves as gods and expect their subordinates to worship them.  14. There is so much uncertainity in the company that Every other employee tries to eat your job as if he has nothing to do.  15. Every second person is Diabetic, hypertensive, cardiac patient  or any life threatening disease and people have even collapsed and died while on duty.  16. You are bound to lose your skills if you stay more here although company arranges for paid holidays known as soft skill training which has actually no use to employees.  17. A complete show-off culture with everyone working for their bosses and not for the organisation.   18. 360 Degree feedback surveys are done to check employee satisfaction, for which you are supposed to fill it in front of your boss and even if write an honest feedback about the shortcomings of the management , your comes to know about it and then your life is made hell, despite the non disclosure agreement in the survey. This entire activity is fake."

Lots of opportunities to learn. Very skilled colleagues (at least in the finance vertical).    (2) Plenty of opportunities to manage serious projects with real responsibilities, if you satisfy management of your ability to handle them. Once you are accepted as a ""contributing member"" of the team, you will be offered far more respect, more serious projects and more autonomy.    (3) Significant opportunities to work and learn from cross functional teams. If you have a unique skill set, quite common to work with (and learn from) different teams.    (4) New challenges to work on every week: no lack of stimuli.    (5) Excellent team ethic across the board (see (2)).    (6) Frequent opportunities to socialize outside of work.","(1) Not uncommon to spend 12+ hours at the office. Employees are not required to, but is very common, even on company mandated half-days. Interns who have been entrusted responsibilities are expected to, if they want to continue being taken seriously. Fortunately, the exciting fast paced nature of work and excellent team members often make this more than tolerable.    (2) Poor processes are in place to accommodate interns/new employees not from the Young Leaders Program.     (3) Employees/Managers are often swamped; interns, therefore are expected to take initiative and repeatedly ask to be given a chance to contribute (see (2)) . If you don't nudge repeatedly, you will spend the entire period of internship doing nothing. It will still be a while before you are entrusted with any real tasks. You just have to trudge through this part. Unfortunately, in case of summer internships, your time will be over before you get to any real tasks."

Horrible company to start your career with. Young college graduates are lured in with gimmicks and fancy words such as 'Young Leaders' and 'Young Technical Leaders', but in reality the work is menial, dull, repetitive. Not to mention, one can get a call/email even at 3:00 AM at night and the management expects you to answer it/reply by 7:00 A. Else, embrace yourself to handle an escalated complaint.

"January 29, 2009",Bharti Airtel is a company you can retire with,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,,Assistant Manager,I worked at Bharti Airtel ,The brand and the general quality of the senior management. The take home in terms of experience and knowledge is very good provided a sincere effort is attempted from the side of the employee. The sharing of knowledge is absolutely completed. There are adequate number of leaves and the five day working day is comparable to any MNC. There are platforms for employee get togethers and adequate training on relevant matters as required for the execution of your job profile. The employee engagement programes are also good.  The rating system on the performance is generally fair and transparent and the ESOP scheme also,The pressure to perform is very severe from the top level and it gets cascaded to all the levels. Even though there is not much politics the dependence on the individual rating officer sometimes help earning average ratings which ultimately affect the compensation. The HR team is not upto the mark in terms of employee benefits and not easily disclose people policies. the onus is on the employee to find out the policies and how it will benefit him. the cost control measures sometimes goes to such levels that various inhouse parties and get togethers are not approved. the level of hierarchy is too complicated
